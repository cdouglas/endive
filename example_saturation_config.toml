# Example: Custom saturation threshold configuration
#
# This example shows how to customize the saturation annotation
# that appears in latency vs throughput plots.
#
# Usage:
#   python -m endive.saturation_analysis --config example_saturation_config.toml

input_dir = "experiments"
output_dir = "plots"
pattern = "exp2_*"

# Saturation annotation settings
[plots.saturation]
# Enable or disable saturation annotations
enabled = true

# Success rate threshold for marking saturation (percentage)
# Default: 50.0 (marks when success rate drops to ~50%)
# Examples:
#   - 50.0: Standard saturation (50% failure rate)
#   - 60.0: Conservative saturation (40% failure rate)
#   - 30.0: Aggressive saturation (70% failure rate)
threshold = 50.0

# Tolerance for detecting saturation point (percentage)
# Used to find data points near the threshold
# Default: 5.0 (looks for points within ±5% of threshold)
tolerance = 5.0

# Example configurations:

# Disable saturation annotations entirely:
# [plots.saturation]
# enabled = false

# Use a 60% success rate threshold (more conservative):
# [plots.saturation]
# enabled = true
# threshold = 60.0
# tolerance = 5.0

# Use a 30% success rate threshold (show severe saturation):
# [plots.saturation]
# enabled = true
# threshold = 30.0
# tolerance = 10.0
