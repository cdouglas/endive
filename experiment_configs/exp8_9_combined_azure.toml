# Experiment 8.9: Combined Optimizations on Azure Blob Storage (Standard)
#
# Research Question: What is the combined effect of metadata separation
# and ML+ mode on Azure standard tier with its extreme heavy tails?
#
# This is the most challenging scenario: Azure standard's heavy tails
# mean each additional operation has a high chance of hitting tail latencies.
