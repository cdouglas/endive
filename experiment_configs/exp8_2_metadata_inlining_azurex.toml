# Experiment 8.2: Table Metadata Inlining Impact on Azure Premium
#
# Research Question: How does disabling table metadata inlining affect
# commit latency on Azure Premium Block Blob?
#
# Azure Premium has:
# - CAS median ~64ms (vs S3 Express ~22ms)
# - Heavy-tailed CAS distribution (sigma=0.73)
# - Append failures are 36x slower than successes
#
# The overhead of non-inlined metadata may be proportionally smaller
# but compounded by Azure's heavier tail latency.
#
# Run with both inlined=true (baseline) and inlined=false to compare.
