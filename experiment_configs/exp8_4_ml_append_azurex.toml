# Experiment 8.4: Manifest List Append Mode on Azure Premium (CAS Catalog)
#
# Research Question: How does ML+ mode perform on Azure Premium,
# given Azure's dramatically different failure characteristics?
#
# Key Azure considerations:
# - CAS has heavy tails (sigma=0.73, p99/p50 ~10x)
# - Append failures are 36x slower than successes
# - Contention scaling is high for CAS (6x at 16 threads)
#
# ML+ mode may help by reducing manifest list I/O, but if append
# failures occur, they're extremely expensive on Azure.
