# Experiment 8.6: Combined Optimizations on Azure Premium Block Blob
#
# Research Question: What is the combined effect of metadata separation
# and ML+ mode on Azure Premium, with its heavy-tailed distributions?
#
# Azure-specific concerns:
# - CAS heavy tails (p99 can be 10x+ median)
# - Append failures are 36x slower than successes
# - Additional I/O from non-inlined metadata may hit tail latencies
#
# This is the worst-case scenario for additional I/O: Azure's heavy
# tails mean that each additional operation has a chance of being
# dramatically slow.
