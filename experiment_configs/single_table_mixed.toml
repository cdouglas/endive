# Single Table, Mixed Conflicts
#
# Blog Question 1b: How does adding non-trivial conflicts affect throughput?
#
# Non-trivial conflicts (real conflicts) require additional work:
# - Read conflicting manifest files
# - Rewrite merged manifest files
# - Additional ~50ms per manifest file (parallel up to 4)
#
# Sweep real_conflict_probability: [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0]
# At fixed inter_arrival.scale = 100 (10 TPS offered)
