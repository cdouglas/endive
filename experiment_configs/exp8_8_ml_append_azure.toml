# Experiment 8.8: Manifest List Append Mode on Azure Blob Storage (Standard)
#
# Research Question: How does ML+ mode perform on Azure standard tier,
# given its heavy-tailed latency distributions?
#
# Azure standard has even heavier tails than premium tier.
# Append failures are extremely expensive (~36x slower than success).
