# Experiment 8.7: Table Metadata Inlining Impact on Azure Blob Storage (Standard)
#
# Research Question: How does disabling table metadata inlining affect
# commit latency on Azure standard tier with its heavy-tailed distributions?
#
# When table_metadata_inlined=false, each commit requires additional
# reads/writes to separate table metadata files, adding I/O overhead.
