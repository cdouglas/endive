# Combined Optimizations: S3 with both metadata inlining AND ML+ append
#
# Blog Question 3d: What is the combined effect of both optimizations?
#
# Configuration:
# - table_metadata_inlined = true (no separate metadata I/O)
# - manifest_list_mode = "append" (ML+ mode)
#
# Expected effects:
# - Inlined metadata eliminates table metadata I/O overhead
# - ML+ reduces manifest list rewrite overhead
# - Should achieve best throughput
#
# Sweep inter_arrival.scale: [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
