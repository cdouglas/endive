# Experiment 2.1: Single Table Saturation - False Conflicts Only
#
# Research Question 1a: Find saturation point for single table with false conflicts
#
# Setup:
# - Single table with catalog-level conflicts
# - All conflicts are "false" (version changed but no overlapping data)
# - Infinitely fast catalog (T_CAS = 1ms, T_METADATA_ROOT = 1ms)
# - Realistic storage latencies for manifest lists/files
#
# Expected Results:
# - Low load: ~99% success, low latency (~150ms), linear throughput
# - Medium load: Success drops to 90-95%, latency increases, throughput plateaus
# - High load: Success < 50%, latency explodes, throughput may decrease
#
# How to Run:
# Vary inter_arrival.scale to sweep offered load:
#   inter_arrival.scale = [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
#
# For each load level, run multiple seeds:
#   python -m endive.main experiment_configs/exp2_1_single_table_false_conflicts.toml
