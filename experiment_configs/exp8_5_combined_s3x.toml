# Experiment 8.5: Combined Optimizations on S3 Express One Zone
#
# Research Question: What is the combined effect of:
# - Disabling table metadata inlining (separate metadata files)
# - Using ML+ manifest list append mode
#
# This represents a scenario where:
# - Table metadata is stored separately (e.g., for governance/schema evolution)
# - Manifest lists use append instead of rewrite
#
# Expected effects:
# - Non-inlined metadata adds I/O overhead
# - ML+ reduces manifest list rewrite overhead
# - Net effect depends on relative costs
