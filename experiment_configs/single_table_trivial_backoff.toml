# Single Table, Trivial Conflicts with Exponential Backoff
#
# Same as single_table_trivial.toml but with exponential backoff on retry.
# This is more realistic than immediate retry.
#
# Backoff: 10ms base, 2x multiplier, 5s max, 10% jitter
# (Still more aggressive than Iceberg's default)
#
# Sweep inter_arrival.scale: [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
