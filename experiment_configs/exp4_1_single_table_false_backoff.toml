# Experiment 4.1: Single Table Saturation with Exponential Backoff
#
# Research Question 4a: Does exponential backoff improve performance under contention?
#
# Comparison with Exp 2.1:
# - Same setup: single table, false conflicts, fast catalog
# - NEW: Exponential backoff on retry (10ms base, 2x multiplier, 5s max)
#
# Expected Results:
# - Backoff may reduce wasted CAS attempts during high contention
# - Trade-off: lower retry overhead vs longer time to success
# - Success rate and throughput curves may shift compared to exp2.1
#
# How to Run:
# Vary inter_arrival.scale to sweep offered load:
#   inter_arrival.scale = [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
#
# For each load level, run multiple seeds:
#   python -m icecap.main experiment_configs/exp4_1_single_table_false_backoff.toml
