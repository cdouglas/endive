# Experiment 8.1: Table Metadata Inlining Impact on S3 Express One Zone
#
# Research Question: How does disabling table metadata inlining affect
# commit latency on S3 Express One Zone (low-latency storage)?
#
# When table_metadata_inlined=false, each commit requires additional
# reads/writes to separate table metadata files, adding I/O overhead.
# On S3 Express with ~22ms CAS latency, this overhead may be significant.
#
# Run with both inlined=true (baseline) and inlined=false to compare.
