# Experiment 3.1: Single Table Saturation - Real Conflict Impact
#
# Research Question 1b: Show how real conflicts shift saturation point
#
# Setup:
# - Single table with catalog-level conflicts
# - Variable probability of real conflicts (requires manifest file operations)
# - Infinitely fast catalog (T_CAS = 1ms, T_METADATA_ROOT = 1ms)
# - Realistic storage latencies for manifest lists/files
#
# Expected Results:
# - Higher real_conflict_probability → earlier saturation
# - Much higher retry latency due to manifest file read/write operations
# - Lower maximum achievable throughput
#
# How to Run:
# Sweep both real_conflict_probability and inter_arrival.scale:
#   real_conflict_probability = [0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1.0]
#   inter_arrival.scale = [10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, 2000, 5000]
#
# For each combination, run multiple seeds:
#   python -m endive.main experiment_configs/exp3_1_single_table_real_conflicts.toml
